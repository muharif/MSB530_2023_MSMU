## Transcriptomics Data Analysis
For this hands-on experience assignment, we will analyze transcriptomics data from real and published studies. To facilitate the analysis, we will use an online tool called [BioJupies](https://maayanlab.cloud/biojupies/).

## Data to Analyze
1. Group 1: Healthy vs Pulmonary Fibrosis Patient Lung. The data can be retrieved from (GSE92592)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92592]. Original Publication is [Cellular senescence mediates fibrotic pulmonary disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14532)
